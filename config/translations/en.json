  "subline": "Mongolian School of Colorado has been operating since 2006. Our passion to pass on the traditions, values and build community has motivated us over the years. In 2020, we received our 501(c)(3) nonprofit status and have expanded our operations. We are grateful to have the opportunity to be a hub for the community and support our kids. It is important for us to instill in our Mongolian-American children that their dual-identities are valued and celebrated and teach them the importance of keeping Mongolian traditions part of their lives.",
