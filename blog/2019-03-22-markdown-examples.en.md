The Youth Club emphasizes the importance and skills necessary relating to college and future readiness, leadership and interpersonal development, mental health awareness, parental engagement, and any additional needs from its youth members. In addition, the Youth Club works to further support the needs of its members by involving the youth on what they aspire to learn during the academic year. Through exciting and entertaining activities, the Youth Club helps youth members further develop important skill sets while allowing them to build a long-lasting community and friendships.

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

## Blockquotes

```Markdown
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
