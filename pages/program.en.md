 By working with our students from toddlers to young adults and their parents, we bridge the gaps in generational, cultural, and language barriers our families encounter as Mongolian-Americans.
 Our focus areas are:



### Language/Cultural Program:
Focuses on teaching the Mongolian language, culture, history, and traditions.
### Youth Club: 
 Emphasizes on college and career preparation, leadership development, mental health and identity awareness.
### Parent Network: 
 Provides a platform for parents to connect and learn meaningful ways to support our teensâ€™ self-confidence, and tools to navigate different cultures, systems and expectations.
### Community Support: 
 We take a leadership role in organizing community events such as census counts, hosting vaccination clinics, community wide holidays and celebrations.

Please join us in achieving our goal of financial and organizational strength through donations and contributions to enhance our Community Success.
